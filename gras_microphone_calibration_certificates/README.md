# G.R.A.S microphone calibration certificates
This folder has the sensitivity measurements done under controlled lab settings for the GRAS calibration microphones. 

There may be multiple microphones of the same model - so it's very important to check that the serial numbers match!

* GRAS 40 DP : pressure-microphone - pay attention, this is not a free-field microphone. The corresponding sensitivity measurements are also pressure-field measurements: `26112 - 40DP#78688 (26112).pdf`

* GRAS 40 BF: free-field microphone. Pay attention to the serial numbers 
	* For Sr. No. 69492: `26111 - 40BF#69492 (26111)-1.pdf`
