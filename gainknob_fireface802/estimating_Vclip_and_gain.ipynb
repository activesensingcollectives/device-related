    "I've had this suspicion that the Fireface 802 gain knob on channels 9-12 is *not* linear, and some pilot data of mine has already shown this. This notebook will now do a thorough job and calculate the gain at each of the knob positions, but also measure the $V_{clip}$ of each channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to measure $V_{clip}$ and gain values?\n",
    "The idea is that we feed in at least two different $V_{rms}$ signals for each knob position to estimate both Vclip and gain value in a channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The max possible value of measured RMS on a channel is fixed: ($\\frac{\\sqrt(2)}{2}$~0.707) - and is hit when we reach the $Vclip$. We can thus calculate the RMS re max each time and use it to simplify our math. \n",
    "\n",
    "$RMS_{norm} = \\frac{V_{rms \\ in}}{V_{rms-clip}}$ (eq. 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "And when we take measurements with a known $V_{rms \\ in}$, then the normalised RMS we get is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$RMS_{norm} = \\frac{V_{rms \\ in}}{V_{rms-clip}} \\times gain $ (eq. 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle we could already use this itself to perform parameter estimation with multiple $V_{rms \\ in}$ values at each gain position, however I chose to convert this equation into a linear form in the decibel scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$dB(RMS_{norm}) = dB(V_{rms \\ in}) - dB(V_{rms-clip}) + dB(gain) $ (eq. 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "And by comparing the $dB(RMS_{norm})$ observed and expected for various values of $dBgain$ and $V_{rmsclip}$ we can then find the best estimates. \n",

    "## The setup\n",
    "\n",
    "An oscilloscope + signal generator running at 1 Mhz/s sampling rate (Keysight INfiniiVision DSO-X-2004A was used to generate 20 kHz sinusoids with varying Vpp using a BNC-audio jack (6.3mm) cable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sinusoid voltage signal was fed into the Instrument line of channels 9-12 with differing Vpp and gain positions on the knobs in 'Lo gain' mode. The voltage signals had the following Vpp values: 100, 200, 500 and 1000 mVpp. \n",

    "\n",
    "After multiple rounds of data collection, I realised only signals $\\geq$ 50 mVpp were recorded and amplified properly - and thus only 100mVpp and above were used. *This meant that we DON'T have an estimate of position 8* - which is supposed to be +60 dB gain. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The gain positions \n",
    "The gain positions were labelled 0-8 in a clockwise fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The analysis\n",
    "The estimation of gain for each position was done in two steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *relative* gain of each position with reference to position 0 was calculated. The dBrms at each position was subtracted from that of the 0th position for a given input Vpp. \n",
    "2. The *absolute* gain of the 0th position and $V_{rmsclip}$ of each channel was estimated using a least-squares fit with equation 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What the user-manual says\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gain values \n",
    "The expected gain of the 0th position is +6 dB, and of the 4th position is +30 dB. The 8th position is expected to be +60 dB, but this could not be verified in the experiment because low signal voltages were not getting picked up properly despite the claim that a Vrms of -33 dBu could be fed into the instrument jack in the user's manual. \n",
    "\n",
    "### $V_{rms clip}$\n",
    "The $V_{rms clip}$ is supposed to be 27 dBu, (the reference of 0 dBu is 0.775Vrms), which corresponds to 17.35 Vrms. \n",
