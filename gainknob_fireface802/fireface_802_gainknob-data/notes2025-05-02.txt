Characterising gain values across channels 9-12 on the Fireface 802
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Using a dedicated Audio-mono-6 mm jack to BNC cable
* Keysight INfiniiVision DSO-X-2004A wavegen function to generate 20 kHz sinusoids with varying Vpp
	* Feeding the sinsoid voltage signal into the Instrument line of channels 9-12 with differing Vpp and gain positions on the knobs
* Fireface 802 Serial number 23746770 (bar code number next to the analog inputs at the back)
* Audio recording done with Audacity 3.3.2 on Windows 10 Laptop using Windows WASAPI and either 'Recording device' -> (Analog 9+10 Fireface 802) OR (Analog 11+12 Fireface 802)

Position 0 is +6 dB defined
position 1-3: TO BE checked
position 4 : +30 dB defined
position 5-7: TO BE checked
position 8: +60 dB defined


3 different types of recordings done: 
> 50mVpp at +60 dB gain (pos 8)
> 30mVpp from positions 4-8
> 500Vpp from positions 0-4
