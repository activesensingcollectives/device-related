```

## Estimating the gain at the knob markings and the Vclip of channels 9-12 instrument line

```{r load-packages}

data = read.csv('all_rms_measurements.csv')
dB <- function(X){20*log10(X)}

data$dBrms_remax <- dB(data$measured_rel_maxrms)
data$dBVinrms <- dB(data$input_vrms)
data$gain_position <- as.factor(data$gain_position)

model1 <- lm(dBrms_remax ~ dBVinrms + gain_position , data=data)

predict(model1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
