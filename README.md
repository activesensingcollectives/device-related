Some parameters of the devices we use in the lab

## Fireface 802 gain knob and Vcliprms
The gain knob of the Fireface 802 channels 9-12 is a weird creature.

The gain is NOT linear as you turn the knob clockwise, and it's not entirely clear how trustable the labelled gain positions are, and what the gain is at intermediate positions. 

For more on the Fireface 802 gain knob and the Vcliprms measurements - see [here](gainknob_fireface802/estimating_Vclip_and_gain.pdf)

## G.R.A.S microphone sensitivity measurements
We have various types of GRAS mics in the lab, and while they are generally flat - it's important to know *how* flat exactly they are across the frequency range we use. 

The lab-grade sensitivity measurements are [here](gras_microphone_calibration_certificates/) - see the README for more context.
