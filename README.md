## Fireface 802 gain knob (only as a guideline...to be updated and revisited...)
The gain knob of the Fireface 802 channels 9-12 is a weird creature.

The gain is NOT linear as you turn the knob clockwise. 
Here is a *very* preliminary measurement just to give you an idea:

The degrees on the x-axis refer to each of the tick marks, with the +6 gain as the '0'. The +30 and +60 dB gain also fall a bit short by being 1 dB less than promised!
